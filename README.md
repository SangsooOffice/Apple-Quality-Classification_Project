# Project Title
Prediction of Apple quality prediction based on apple data.

# Why I do this project?
The Korean agricultural sector currently has a serious shortage of manpower. Among them, lack of consistency, low efficiency, and excessive time and cost in the agricultural quality screening process are pointed out as major problems.In addition, the decline in the overall population and the rapid decline of primary industry workers are intensifying this problem, and automation in the agricultural quality process is emerging as a major challenge. So, we selected the topic of apple quality prediction using apple data.


# Project Process
**Preprocessing**
- The original data was modified to 6-angle multi-view data.
- Image normalization and image resize were performed.

**Modeling**
- Apple quality classification by combining apple's multiview data and apple weight data.
- Apple quality classification was conducted using Resnet, Efficientnet, Densenet
 
 **Model Flowchart**
 + Overall flowchart
